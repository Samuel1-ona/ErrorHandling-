# Error Handling Example Smart Contract

This smart contract, written in Solidity (version 0.8.20), showcases basic error handling mechanisms including require, assert, and revert statements, while also implementing a simple ownership model. It's designed to manage a balance within the contract, with functions to deposit, withdraw, and reset the contract state, ensuring that operations are performed safely and correctly.
Features

    Ownership Control: The contract initializes with the deployer's address as the owner, ensuring that certain actions can only be performed by the owner.

    Deposit Functionality: Allows any caller to deposit funds into the contract. The deposit amount must be greater than zero.

    Withdraw Functionality: Enables the owner to withdraw funds from the contract. This function checks for sufficient balance and restricts the action to the owner only.

    Reset Contract State: Provides a mechanism for the owner to reset the contract's state, under the condition that the contract's balance is zero. This action is safeguarded by a revert statement for additional safety.

    Error Handling: Utilizes require for input validation and preconditions, assert for internal sanity checks, and revert for conditional logic that might require reverting the transaction under specific circumstances.
